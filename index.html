    <h3>Sports One Must Play</h3>
    <p>Sports have more value than just the face-value physical benefits. I think everyone should play a sport
        long-term. Playing multiple sports can give participants a broad range of skills and coping mechanisms that are
        so valuable in life. The below table suggests some sports that one should play for a healthy living.</p>
