    <h3><b>My Favourite Food- Biryani</b></h3>
    <p>
        People possess varying preferences and tastes, recognizing that exceptions exist, and I wholeheartedly respect
        those differences. For those unfamiliar with Biryani or only vaguely acquainted with it, allow me to convey that
        Biryani transcends being merely a fusion of rice, spices, and meat in my eyes. It should be crafted with an
        abundance of affection
        and savored with unwavering focus to relish every delectable bite. Hyderabadi Biryani is a renowned and
        cherished variety of biryani that originates from the city of Hyderabad in India. It's celebrated for its unique
        blend of aromatic spices, fragrant Basmati rice, and tender meat, usually chicken or goat. What sets Hyderabadi
        Biryani apart is the cooking method, which involves layering marinated meat and partially cooked rice in a
        heavy-bottomed vessel, sealing it with dough to trap the steam, and slow-cooking it to perfection. This results
        in a flavorful and aromatic dish with distinct flavors and textures that make it a favorite among biryani
        enthusiasts. The Hyderabadi Biryani is often served with raita (yogurt sauce) or mirchi ka salan (spicy chili
        curry) to complement its rich and spicy flavors.
